Supply Chain Analytics: Risk, Fraud & Profitability Optimization
📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive end-to-end analysis of a global supply chain dataset. By integrating Python for data engineering, SQL for deep-dive querying, and Power BI for executive storytelling, I identified critical operational bottlenecks that lead to late deliveries, fraudulent transactions, and profit loss.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Cleaning: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Seaborn, Matplotlib

Database Management: MySQL (Complex joins, Date/Time functions)

Business Intelligence: Power BI (DAX, Interactive Dashboards)

📊 Key Business Insights
1. Delivery Time-Series Analysis
The Weekend Bottleneck: Discovered that late delivery risk increases by X% on orders placed on Saturdays and Sundays.

Seasonal Spikes: Identified specific months (Q4) where shipping infrastructure is most strained.

Impact: Provided a data-backed recommendation to increase Sunday warehouse staffing to eliminate Monday backlogs.

2. Profitability & "Bleeding" Categories
Identified that specific categories (e.g., Fishing and Fan Shop) frequently generate negative profit despite high sales volume.

Correlated losses with inefficient shipping modes used for low-margin products.

Recommendation: Adjusted shipping pricing strategies for high-volume, low-margin items.

3. Fraud Risk Mitigation
Isolated "Suspected Fraud" patterns using multi-dimensional filtering.

Mapped fraud spikes to specific international shipping routes and customer segments.

📈 Dashboard Features
Executive KPIs: Instant visibility into Total Profit, Late Delivery Rate, and Fraud Counts.

Risk Heatmap: A matrix visual showing "Danger Zones" by Month and Day.

Interactive Slicers: Allows managers to filter performance by Shipping Mode, Customer Segment, and Region.

💡 How to use this for your Portfolio:
Add Screenshots: Replace the placeholders in your GitHub with actual screenshots of your Power BI dashboard and your Python charts.

Explain the "Why": In your interview, don't just say you "made a bar chart." Say: "I identified that the Fishing category was losing money because shipping costs weren't being covered by the product price."
